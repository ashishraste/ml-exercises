### Machine Learning exercises

---

#### Source
The exercise problems are taken from [Andrew Ng's Machine Learning MOOC](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home). I look forward to add more problem sets from other sources in future.

#### Folder layout

1. `datasets` : contains all the sample datasets, used in the scripts. 
2. Other Python scripts : contains the solutions.
